# Simple Python Loop to List Comprehension Converter

Thrown together script to convert a simple for-loop to a list-comprehension expression.

I hope to rewrite this with actual Lexical Analysis / Tokenization at some point
to be a little more robust.

Inspired by Trey Hunter's post on list comprehension [here](https://treyhunner.com/2015/12/python-list-comprehensions-now-in-color/).

A much, much better version of this by Chelsea Voss [here](https://onelinepy.herokuapp.com/).
